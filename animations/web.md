> This slide explains how composite property works. And according to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/892678387076132865) we are getting a animation-composite property in CSS.

- When clipping with border-radius gets glitchy, the parent can be forced to a new layer with `transform: translateZ(0)` to fix the problem. E.g when a transition bleeds out of its container that already has a `overflow: hidden` set.
