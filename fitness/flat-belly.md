Getting a Flat Belly
======================
Jeff Cavaliere points out in his video that abdominal exercises are good
but they don't make you lose belly fat. Good and consistent abdominal
workouts will build abs but then abs can't be formed upon a big belly.

Diet has to change and aerobics have to be mixed in exercise routine to
burn existing fat. Even when ripped, fats may still be settled underneath
the obliques.
